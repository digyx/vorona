# Why?
Why not?  Support me on [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/devontingley) if you like my work.  The monthly recurring revenue far outweighs a couple sales lost because you downloaded a PDF or ePub.

# So...why is Amazon Not Free?
Convenience and commitment.  While everything is free on the website, buying on Amazon allows you to support me while also getting the convenience of being able to use a kindle.  Want it for free?  [Here you go.](https://www.sendepubtokindle.com/).
