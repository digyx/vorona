A girl with snow white hair and blue eyes roamed from city to city. She had no mother. She had no father. She had no home. She had nothing but the clothes on her back. The girl sat on the streets, covered in mud, silently hoping that someone, anyone would show her mercy. Dozens of people passed by her, never even looking. Tears filled hers as the cold of the night ate away at her. Days and weeks and months passed.

The children snickered at her, making fun of how she looked. The “adults” threw looks of disgust at her and gossiped just within earshot of her. The girl bottled up all of her feelings, shoving them deep down inside of her, and tried to crush them.

“I’m used to it,” she told herself.

“It doesn’t bother me,” she lied to herself.

Then one of them kicked her. The box inside of her holding all those dark thoughts burst open and consumed her. Azure flames erupted from the ground and wrapped around the abuser, turning them to ash. The flames continued spewing out and flowing through the streets, devouring anything it touched.

The girl, finally, felt warm.
